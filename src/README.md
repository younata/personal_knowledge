# Introduction

Going to store stuff here.

This is inspired by [Nikita's](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) knowledge repository.

The basic idea is, as I come across information - or otherwise generate my own - I write it down in here[^no shit not private info]. This, combined with [tooling](/meta/tooling.md) I'm writing, provides a single, searchable database for things I know. So that I don't have to keep searching how I did something previously. Additionally, this serves to help reinforce things I've learned, both by forcing myself to write down things I learn, as well as write it in a way that should help my future self not have to spend so long figuring out how I did a thing.

[^no shit not private info]: Obviously, I'm going to exercise some discretion and not put things like my tax returns or whatever.
