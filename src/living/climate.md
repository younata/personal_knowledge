# Addressing Climate Change

The biggest impact you can have on affecting climate change is advocating for climate-friendly policies at all levels of government. This is significantly easier on the local level than at higher levels, but is still something I struggle to do (talking with people? That's terrifying). This is because climate change is a systemic issue, and requires systemic change. 1 person replacing their natural gas appliances with electric ones is basically a rounding error in terms of total emissions. But enacting even local policy banning natural gas appliances will have a significant effect on emissions and overall quality of life. Or enacting a right to repair, and require products to be user-repairable will prevent tons of waste and emissions.

However, for far less but still non-zero effect, there are some things you can do to affect climate change.

As far as spending money (or not), the next best way is to basically not drive places. Ride a bike, walk, whatever. Ebikes, for example, are remarkably cheap nowadays. You can get an acceptable one for less than $500. This'll still get you going up to 20 miles per hour, which is great for around-town errands. Need to carry stuff and/or people? Get a cargo bike. Most cargo bikes nowadays come with some kind of electric assist, and all of them are designed to have electric assist added to them.

If you own a home that has natural gas appliances, replace them with electric equivalents! More so than for climate, burning natural gas in the home has been found to be incredibly bad for your health - turns out "clean burning" natural gas just means it's less dirty than coal. Natural gas still emits tons of carcinogens that you do not want to breath. You don't need to go out and replace perfectly good natural gas appliances. But when they need to be replaced, instead of getting a new natural gas stove, get an induction stove. When your furnace needs to be replaced, get a heat pump. Heat pumps are so good right now, and they work down to really low temperatures. Even if you don't need to replace your furnace, get a heat pump. Most thermostats nowadays will default to the heat pump, and use the gas furnace as an "emergency heat" if necessary.

Lastly, yeah. The big expenses. If you must own a car (which is sadly an unavoidable fact of life in most of the North America), own an electric one. If you can, install solar on your roof. Installing solar also has the benefit of encouraging your neighbors to do so - it's one of the modern "keeping up with the Jones'" things.

Unless you're in California or the grid has otherwise shown to be unreliable, installing something like a powerwall is probably not worth the expense (though, it might be worth it in terms of [emergency prep]({{#path_for Emergency Prep}}). Not likely though. Portable power stations are nearly as good, and are much cheaper). In 2024, the CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) changed the rules for net metering. Previously, any electricity your rooftop solar generated was sold at residential prices. Which meant that effectively the electricity you bought was offset 1-1 with electricity you sold. The CPUC changed this so that you now sell electricity at utility rates, which are far lower than residential rates.

You could also learn to just live with less, but fuck degrowth. Asking people to just accept a lower standard of living does not work. Humans are not a disease.
