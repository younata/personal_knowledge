# Economics

## The Free Market

The free market is an economic system where the prices and availability of things ("goods and services") are determined by supply & demand of buyers and sellers. This contrasts with, say, a command economy, where a central authority determines everything. There are no pure free markets in the world, and you wouldn't want to be a buyer in a free market. Instead, most governments impose regulations on the free market - such as a minimum wage, banning harmful products, and so on.

## Capitalism

Capitalism is an economic system where the amount of capital you have determines your ability to buy and sell things. This is done by imposing a hierarchy and having one or a few at the top control the "means of production". The "means of production" is anything used to create goods or materials. Such as machines, mines, farms, etc.

For example, a factory owner owns the factory and all machines in it that produces shovels. The factory owner then pays workers to actually use the machines to produce the shovels, and the factory owner then turns around and sells the shovels for as high as they can. Any extra profit from that sale goes directly to the factory owner and increases the amount of capital they have.

This capturing of value from workers makes capitalism directly and explicitly exploitative of workers. Workers are creating much more value for the capitalist than they are taking home themselves. This is what the anticapitalist saying "there is no ethical consumption under capitalism" means. Even if every other part of this factory producing shovels operated "ethically" - the metal is recycled, the factory has 0 emissions, etc. - the fact that the workers themselves are being paid less than the value they create makes the system unethical, and therefore it is fundamentally unethical to consume the goods produced. While an ethical wage is necessarily a living wage, a living wage is not necessarily an ethical wage.

## Ethical Consumption & lack thereof

"There is no ethical consumption under capitalism" means that there is no entirely ethical way to purchase, or consume, something. This does not mean to imply that all consumption under capitalism is equally unethical. Buying from a company that utilizes child labor is fundamentally more unethical than buying from a company that does not. Buying from a company employing union labor is fundamentally more ethical than buying from a non-unionized company.

As someone who exists and participates in a capitalist society, you still have a responsibility to not make unethical purchases. Similarly, when looking for who to sell your labor to, you have a responsibility to sell it to the least unethical company possible. Whether you want it or not, the ethical choices of the company you work for reflects on you. This becomes more and more the case the higher up in the company you are. For example, it doesn't really reflect poorly on someone who chooses to work for Facebook as a content moderator because they don't really have any power to make decisions. But it does reflect extremely poorly on senior management.
