# Politics and Leftism

Leftism is essentially the "golden rule" that people are taught in kindergarten - do to others what you'd want others to do to you - applied beyond that.

Leftism is truly about the idea that everyone is and should be equal. No one is inherently better than anyone else, and likewise, no one is less than anyone else.

I am very explicitly a leftist, with my views only having shifted more and more leftward on the political spectrum as I've grown and learned.
