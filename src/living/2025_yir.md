# 2025 Year in Review

2025 was a very big year for us. We bought a plane! It's an RV-9A. We took it on some pretty fun trips.

The seller and I flew it from San Diego up to the Pacific Northwest. Along the route, we diverted slightly to go check out [Crater Lake in southern Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake_National_Park)!

## Nicole's internship

Nicole had an internship down in the SF Bay Area this summer, this is her enjoying some coffee out of a flask at a coffee shop in Berkeley.

## Flying along the Oregon Coast

With the new plane, we went on many adventures! Here's some flying along the Oregon Coast.

## Flying to the SF Bay

Later this summer, I flew down to the Bay Area to go visit Nicole, here's my favorite photo, looking at Shasta Lake in Northern California, from just east of Mt. Shasta. No I didn't think to get a photo of Mt Shasta itself.

On the way back, Nicole joined me, and because it was close to the end of her internship, we also took a bunch of stuff with us. A week later, when she actually finished, she only had a couple bags that should could carry-on the commercial flight with her.

## Visiting Seattle

Near the end of the summer, we flew ourselves to Seattle for a weekend.

Here's a view from the Seattle waterfront, looking at downtown.

And of course, we had to visit Pike Place Market. This was in the evening once it was closed. We went across the street and had some lovely crab.

Us flying home, the sun was in just the right place that the roll bar kept it out of my eyes.

And Portland. This was during a lot of the ICE raids where 47 was claiming it to be a war zone. Seems peaceful to me.
