# Personal Growth

Notes/thoughts on personal growth/adulting.

1. Think before you act.
   Almost every single thing I regret in my life (and, wow, there are many) are because I didn't think before I acted.
2. There is always time to think.
   If you ever ask yourself "should I do/not do X?", the answer is usually "don't". 
3. It's not about you.
   Growing up, I was incredibly self-centered. A lot of my journey through life has involved learning to not be as self-centered.
4. Actions matter more than just about everything else.
   - Saying you'll do X matters way less than actually doing X.
   - In some cases, it's actively harmful to commit to doing X when you could've just done X.
