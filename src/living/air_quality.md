# Maintaining Air Quality

Running air purifiers is one of the best ways to maintain high air quality indoors. However, instead of buying some, you can make your own for relatively little.

Whether this is a basic corsi-rosenthal box, with a 20" box fan attached to 4 or 5 furnace filters, or one of the fancier CR boxes using high-end PC fans. This is still a fairly cheap way to maintain clean air, especially over time. Furnace filters with high MERV ratings (at least 12) are nearly as good as HEPA filters, but are much cheaper & you can find them easily at any hardware store.
