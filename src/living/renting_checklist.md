# Renting Checklist

Things to check/verify when checking out a place to rent.

## HVAC & Utilities

- Central or Wall AC
- Heating? What's that like?

- Water
  - Verify all sinks, showers, and toilets work.
  - Check how how they take and how long it takes sinks & showers to get hot.
  - Verify shower pressure
  - Verify no toilet backup
- Laundry
  - In-Unit laundry will generally be more expensive, but is far and away worth it.

## Garage

- Shared? Or are we the only ones with access?
- What's it wired for? (220 V AC would be great for EV charging)

    - Gas looks appealing thanks to marketing, but you really don't want to deal with the negative health effects.
  - How old is it? Is it likely to need replacing while you're there?
  - Do burners all work?
  - Is there a smell when things are off?
- Verify that all cupboards are clean. Shine a light in them.
- Dishwasher

## Bathrooms

## Previous/Current Tenants
