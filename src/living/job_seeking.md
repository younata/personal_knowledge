# Interviewing

Notes/Reminders on what to ask when interviewing for a job.

Ultimately, a lot of this is based on my own bad experience with previous jobs.

i.e. this is where I shit on my previous companies.

## Technical Interviews

- What's your tech stack look like?
- What are some practices you/the team wants to follow, but has difficulty doing so?
- How do you feel about third party frameworks?
- How do you spread knowledge amongst members of the team? How do you support this kind of professional growth?
- What's the expected on-call stuff like?

### iOS-Specific technical questions

- How do you feel about storyboards? Nibs? Laying out in code? Autolayout/others?
- How far back in terms of versions do you typically support?

### Testing & QA

- What's your testing strategy look like?
- How do you handle testing network requests?
- How do you handle testing that the UI is wired up correctly?
- How do you feel about XCUITest? (Obviously iOS specific)
- How do you feel about xUnit-style frameworks?
- How do you feel about rspec-style frameworks?
- How reliable is your CI? What all do you have CI doing for you? (Verifying tests is usually a given)

- What's the PR flow like for you all?
  - How is the flow when a PR gets updated after being marked as approved?
- How do you verify things work before deploying? What's the workflow like after a PR gets merged?

### Automation and Deployment

- What do your deployments look like? Are they automated, why/why not? How automated are they?
- How do you address bad deployments? How does rolling back look like?

### General/Non-workflow Questions

- What do you like best about working at $YOUR\_COMPANY?
  - What frustrates you the most about it?
  - (Or: what would you change if you could)
- If manager: How do you feel about your reports
- How do you feel about your manager? (Still valid when asking managers, you know. Unless you're interviewing the CEO)
