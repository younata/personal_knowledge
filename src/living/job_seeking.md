# Job Interviewing

Notes/Reminders on what to ask when interviewing for a job.

## Recruiter/Hiring Manager Screens

Some are very iOS specific.

- Which particular team is this role for? What can you tell me about them?
- Does the team own the entire iOS app, or only a portion of it?
- How cohesive is the team?
- What's the remote work policy?

## Technical Interviews

- What's your tech stack look like?
- What are some practices you/the team wants to follow, but has difficulty doing so?
- Similarly, what are some practices you/the team does follow, but you wish you wouldn't?
- How do you feel about third party frameworks?
- How do you spread knowledge amongst members of the team? How do you support this kind of professional growth?
- What's your on-call rotation look like?

### iOS-Specific technical questions

- How do you feel about storyboards? Nibs? Laying out in code? Autolayout/others? SwiftUI?
- How far back in terms of versions do you typically support?

### Testing & QA

- What's your testing strategy look like?
  - How do you feel about TDD?
- How do you handle testing network requests?
- How do you handle testing that the UI is wired up correctly?
- How do you feel about XCUITest? (Obviously iOS specific)
- How do you feel about xUnit-style frameworks?
- How do you feel about rspec-style frameworks?
- How reliable is your CI? What all do you have CI doing for you? (Verifying tests is usually a given)

- What's the PR flow like for you all?
  - How is the flow when a PR gets updated after being marked as approved?
- How do you verify things work before deploying? What's the workflow like after a PR gets merged?

### Automation and Deployment

- What do your deployments look like? Are they automated, why/why not? How automated are they?
- How do you address bad deployments? How does rolling back look like?

### General/Non-workflow Questions

- What do you like best about working at $YOUR\_COMPANY?
  - What frustrates you the most about it?
  - (Or: what would you change if you could)
- What does the team do to make sure that each person feels appreciated and that their work is valued?
- If manager: How do you feel about your reports
- How do you feel about your manager? (Still valid when asking managers, you know. Unless you're interviewing the CEO)


### Other?

(Sourced from a friend who has done a ton of tech recruiting at a FAANG).

- Why this team? (Why did the interviewer choose to work on this team?)
- If the interviewer has been at the company a long time: What has kept them there?
- What do you think is the biggest risk to the project/product/team/company? (Depending on what feels most appropriate with the person you're talking to)
- How good do you think the team/company is at cross collaboration? What teams does the team collaborate most closely with, and how do you think collaboration could be improved?

- What do you like most about the work from a technical perspective?
- What do you think is the part of the technical work that most needs to be improved?
- What are the methods/mechanisms/ways for ICs to give feedback/input on technical decisions or things that could be improved?

- As a technical contributor how closely/often do you work with non-technical folks involved in product decisions (e.g. sales, PM, design, etc.) and how does that communication take place?
- How do you think the team/company does at getting those different parts of product to work together?

- How often do you do interviews?
- Why are you doing this interview? (Checking if their answer implies it's because they enjoy it or because they were forced to)
- Do you from the interviewer side like the interview/recruiting process at $COMPANY? How do you think that process could be improved?
- When you look at the next 6 month/year/5 years of work at $COMPANY, what are you most excited about?

- Assuming these interviews go well, do you think I should take this position? (risky!)

### General Advice/help brainstorming

Assuming you get offers from all the places you're talking to for the same comp/benefits, what are the things you'd want to know about each position in order to choose one.

Think about what you hated about previous jobs and think about why you weren't able to predict those things going in.
Same thing for things you loved that surprised you didn't know they were going to exist until you started working there.

Prioritize figuring out whether interviewers feel comfortable discussing things they think the team/company needs to work on/improve upon. If they claim everything is perfect/avoid answering about negative aspects, then that's a huge red flag.
If they are open & honest about what needs improvement, follow up on that. Otherwise, don't bother.

For remote: Ask how the company/team does with working remotely. Even for hybrid folks, how does it work when the team isn't in the office, or when they need to coordinate with teams in other offices.

#### Potential Teammates

Try to figure out if the interviewer seems to enjoy their job.
- Are they excited when they talk about it?
- Do they answer questions about positive aspects quickly?
- Do they answer questions, especially ones about the future, in a way that implies they plan to stay?
  - Figuring out if they're going to stay is especially important if the people you'll be working with are a strong factor in why you chose that job.

Try to figure out if your standards and qualifications are similar to theirs. i.e. their approach to testing.
