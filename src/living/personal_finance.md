# Personal Finance

A lot of my views on personal finance come from [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com).

## Budgeting

I don't practice anything formal like [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com). I do keep track of my finances using [ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org) with [ledger-autosync](https://github.com/egh/ledger-autosync) to automate syncing that, and I occasionally review the status of where I spend money to reduce expenses.

Overall, my system for spending follows this order:

1. Rent & other debts (car payment, internet, phone, etc.)
2. Food & other necessities (clothing, etc.)
    - I prefer to spend on groceries vs. eating out. While the notion that a $5/day coffee habit keeps you poor is ridiculous, you generally end up with better food once you learn how to make it yourself. It's better to reserve eating out as a special thing.
3. Everything else.

In general, anything that falls under "everything else" is something I spend at least a day thinking about before I decide whether to get it or not. The more expensive it is, the longer I spend thinking on it.

For especially large purchases, I actually do set up budgeting. This works out as a using [ledger's virtual postings feature](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Virtual-postings) to place money in an account prefixed with "Budget" every time I get paid. That is, it's [envelope budgeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_budget#Envelopes) for a single large purchase.

### Buying Used vs. New

I'm really bad at this. I should prefer used, but I often go for new just because it's easier and faster. This is a habit I'm working on correcting.

## Investing

Any money you invest, treat it as if it no longer exists. Especially for 401k or other retirement accounts that have a penalty if you access them before some age.

### 401k

Always contribute at least the minimum to get your company to max out their matching.
For example, if your company does matching up to 4%, then at least put in that 4%.

- If your company offers both [401k and Roth 401k](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/roth-401k-vs-401k/), then do a pre-tax contribution and invest the tax savings.
    - If you don't think you'll invest the tax savings, then contribute to the post-tax 401k.
    - On the other hand, if you're currently in a high tax bracket (and have low expenses), then put the money in the pre-tax 401k.
- Just set it, and check on it every year as the contribution limit changes, or your company changes their matching policy.

### Index Funds

- [Picking stocks is for fools, buy index funds](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/18/how-to-make-money-in-the-stock-market/).
    - [Betterment](https://betterment.com) is what I use for my non-401k investments.
- The S&P 500 environmental and socially responsible index has outperformed the S&P 500 since it was launched.
    - Which means that doing the right thing **is** financially responsible.
        - Note that companies included in ESR funds are not necessarily what you might think of as "environmentally and socially responsible". They might just be less irresponsible than ones in the S&P 500.
    - The vanguard [ESGV](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/ESGV) and [VSGX](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VSGX) funds are their US and International socially responsible index funds.
