# Emergency Prep

This is not to say that I'm a prepper, but rather notes on preparing for natural disasters and the like.

Note: The BEST thing to do here is to build and be a part of a community. One of the long-running threads of human history & human society is that we can accomplish so much more if we work together than if we all try to do everything ourselves. Your survival of an emergency is much more likely in a group than by yourself.

If you live in an area with natural disaster "seasons", then be sure to double-check your supplies before the start of each season. e.g. if you live in the American South, or on the East Coast of the US, check your supplies in May/June prior to Hurricane season. On the west coast, there's always the threat of earthquakes, but fire season is also a thing in the summer to make sure you're prepared for things.

## Water

Assume that you will use 1 gallon of water per person, per day. More if you live in warmer climates.

<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/water-emergency/about/how-to-create-and-store-an-emergency-water-supply.html" data-proofer-ignore>Per the CDC (in late 2024)</a>, store at least 2 weeks worth of potable water. You want at least 1 gallon (~4 liters) of water per person, per day. So, for 2 people, you need (14 days * 1 gallon/person/day * 2 people = 28 gallons/106 liters of water). Set a reminder every 6 months to replace your supply by dumping the containers, washing them, and replacing with fresh water. Ideally, you want to stagger out the replacement to keep things somewhat fresh. Say, replace half the supply every 3 months.

Store the water in a cool (50-70F/10-20C), dark place, away from other chemicals. Use stackable containers to minimize the required storage space. Be sure to label the water & when it was last replaced.

Cleaning:

- Wash and clean the containers using soap & water.
- Then sanitize by using a mixture of 1 teaspoon of bleach ("liquid household chlorine bleach [...] that contains 5%-9% sodium hypochlorite") with 1 quart (4 cups) of water.
  - Cover the container & shake it to ensure every surface gets covered.
  - Wait 30 seconds, then pour the sanitizing solution out of the container
- Let it completely air-dry, then fill the container with clean water

Using:

- For drinking, it would be a really good idea to pass it through an activated charcoal filter to help with the taste.
- To avoid contamination, Do not touch the water or inside of the container with your hands, or with a dirty scoop.

## Food

Keep a 2-week supply of food that you know you will eat. Don't just buy some MREs that are shelf-stable for years but taste so bad you refuse to eat them. Instead, build up a supply by buying slightly more of your regular groceries than you otherwise would. Swap these out frequently by eating the oldest things first. This way you know for a fact that you have a good supply of food that's both edible and you enjoy eating. This is not to say that you should maintain an oversupply of everything you might want to eat, but rather that you should maintain a large-enough supply of various staple-foods. For example, if you enjoy pasta, then have enough to last you several days. Combined with your other staples, you should be able to last 2 weeks.

## Communication

Get a ham radio license & an HT. Learn how to use it, and be comfortable using it. Learn the local repeaters that you can use. Ham radio is point-to-point, decentralized communication that (generally) works when the centralized communication methods go down (e.g. cell, network, landlines - yes, for the purpose of this, internet counts as centralized).

If you want, upgrade to a license that gives you HF privileges (in the US, a general or extra class). This license will allow you to communicate with those beyond line of sight - meaning being able to communicate with those outside of the area (useful for, e.g. getting messages to loved ones to ensure that people survived).

## Power

If you have a powerwall (or equivalent), then you don't really need to worry about power during a natural disaster. Especially if you have rooftop solar. You should disable/turn off nonessential power usages (i.e. everything but heat, refrigeration, cooking), and also make sure that the powerwall is sized to handle a normal load for at least a day and a half, longer if you don't have rooftop solar.

If you don't have a powerwall, then either get an inverter you can power off an ebike battery, or get a power station (which is a high-capacity battery with an inverter built in) from anker/bluetti/ecoflow/jackery/one of the many other companies doing this). These will power emergency essentials for some amount of time in the event a natural disaster hits and the grid goes down for an extended period of time. However, you will likely be unable to power high-power things like heat, especially during winter.  
Additionally, even if you have rooftop solar, you should get dedicated portable solar panels for your power station. This is because, when the grid goes down, your solar install will detect that and disconnect themselves so as to prevent accidentally backfilling the grid. This also means that your house will lose power and you won't be able to power things off of your rooftop solar. Instead, you will have to set up the portable panels and connect them to the power station. This is especially important because power stations have a relatively small capacity. For this same reason, be sure to get a power station with at least 500 watt-hours of capacity (and enough solar to be able to fully charge it at least 2 times during the day. For a 500 Wh battery, this corresponds to just over 150 watts of solar for winter use (500 watt-hours รท 6 daylight-hours/day รท 2 charges/day = 167 watts)).

Don't buy a gas generator, especially not a new one. If you already have one, fine, but a power station or powerwall and solar panels will do a better job providing power and will be long-term cheaper and far easier to maintain. With a gas generator, you're reliant on having access to gas, and also needing to keep it refueled with stabilized gas. They're also loud where power stations are near-silent.
