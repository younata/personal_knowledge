# Astronomy

I love everything related to space, both human exploration of space, and the observation of objects in space.

## Resources

Resources for learning astronomy.

### Richard Pogge's/OSU's Astronomy podcasts

<a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/" data-proofer-ignore>Richard Pogge is a professor at OSU</a>. He recorded the lectures for a few of his "astronomy for non-astronomy majors" classes and posted them online as podcasts. They're absolutely enrapturing to listen to. One of the things I love about these is that he also covers a lot of the history behind astronomy, in addition to what we currently know.

- <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Audio/" data-proofer-ignore>AST 161</a>, from Fall 2007, is an introduction to solar system astronomy. This is absolutely fascinating as in addition to things like the planets and the sun, he also talks about how humans developed astronomy, and how astronomy has influenced all sort sof our culture. In addition to some of the modern things we're learning, as we've sent spacecraft to objects in the solar system.
- <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Audio/" data-proofer-ignore>AST 162</a>, from Winter 2006, is an introduction to stars, galaxies, and cosmology. It covers a bit more of the science behind stars, as well as a lot of the modern history behind how we gained that knowledeg, and how we know it's correct.
- <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast141/Audio/" data-proofer-ignore>AST 141></a>, from Fall 2009, is an introduction to astrobiology. I haven't listened to this one yet, but I'm very much looking forward to listening to it.

He also has some more recent, itunes only content that first started as itunes U collections, before Apple simply made them podcasts. I haven't listened to these yet, but am looking forward to them.

- [Life in the Universe](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/life-in-the-universe/id559775126) is an intro to astrobiolagy - basically the AST 141 podcast with additional material included (slides, video).
- [From Planets to the Cosmos](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/from-planets-to-the-cosmos/id1131597016) appears to be a combination of AST 161 and AST 162, with additional material included (slides, video).
