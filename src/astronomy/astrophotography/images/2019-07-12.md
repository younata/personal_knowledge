# 2019-07-12 Joshua Tree

Went out to Joshua Tree National Park to try out a new scope! I'm very pleased with the results.

# Andromeda Galaxy

I had to wait until about 1:30 AM for Andromeda to be sufficiently high in the sky to clear some ground obstructions (rocks)

This is composed of 100 images stacked together. 10 second exposure, ISO 2000 or so. (Any longer exposure time introduced noticeable star trails, as my mount wasn't perfectly aligned).

# Pleiades

This was the last picture I took - my camera's battery died after taking the first of what would have been 100 images. This was taken at approximately 3 AM.

10 second exposure, forget the ISO speed.
