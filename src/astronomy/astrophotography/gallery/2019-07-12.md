# 2019-07-12 Joshua Tree

Went out to Joshua Tree National Park to try out a new scope! I'm very pleased with the results.

# Jupiter

One of the first things I photographed!

This combined from 200 separate images. Two sets of 100. The first to get details of Jupiter's clouds (ISO 100, 1/200th second exposure, I could have shortened the exposure length even more to get better details). The second to get details of the 4 Galilean moons (ISO 100, 1/10th second exposure). I then stacked each set of 100 into their own image, and replaced the overexposed Jupiter in the picture with the moons with the much better image of Jupiter's clouds. I think it worked out pretty well.

# Andromeda Galaxy

I had to wait until about 1:30 AM for Andromeda to be sufficiently high in the sky to clear some ground obstructions (rocks)

This is composed of 100 images stacked together. 10 second exposure, ISO 2000 or so. (Any longer exposure time introduced noticeable star trails, as my mount wasn't perfectly aligned).

# Pleiades

This was the last picture I took - my camera's battery died after taking the first of what would have been 100 images. This was taken at approximately 3 AM.

10 second exposure, forget the ISO speed.
