First weekend following a new moon, let's get some photos of the stars!

Unlike last time, I made sure to have both camera batteries fully charged. At some point, though, I need to figure out a way to power the things from either my car or possibly an ebike battery.

## Orion Nebula

This was surprisingly easy to capture. This was done with a series of 100 images, ISO 3200, and a 15 second exposure. Stacked (more-or-less automatically), then processed in post to bring out that extra oomph. Cropped from the original to bring more attention to the nebula itself. This nebula is really bright.
