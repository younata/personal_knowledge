# 2019-08-31 Joshua Tree

First weekend following a new moon, let's get some photos of the stars!

Unlike last time, I made sure to have both camera batteries fully charged. At some point, though, I need to figure out a way to power the things from either my car or possibly an ebike battery.

## Orion Nebula

This was surprisingly easy to capture. This was done with a series of 100 images, ISO 3200, and a 15 second exposure. Stacked (more-or-less automatically), then processed in post to bring out that extra oomph. Cropped from the original to bring more attention to the nebula itself. This nebula is really bright.

## California Nebula

[The California Nebula (NGC 1499) is an emission nebula in the constellation Perseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Nebula).

This was quite difficult to capture. Because it's so red, you can't visually see the California Nebula. I could barely make it out on the highest ISO setting my camera can do (25600, wow) at a 20 second exposure. Couldn't do any longer without introducing star trails. I'd love to revisit this once I have autoguiding figured out - or at least with a much better aligned telescope.

Postprocessed to bring out the red. as much as I could.
