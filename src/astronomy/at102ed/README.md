# Astro-Tech AT102ED Telescope

It's a nice, relatively cheap [refracting telescope](https://www.astronomics.com/astro-tech-at102ed-4-f-7-ed-refractor-ota.html).

## Making the Bahtinov Mask

The outer diameter of the leading element is 122mm.

I have a bahtinov mask available [here](bahtinov.stl), it was generated from [this svg](bahtinov.svg), which itself was generated from <a href="http://astrojargon.net/MaskGen.aspx" data-proofer-ignore>this page</a>. The relevant specs for that is it's 102mm diameter lens, and it's 714mm focal length.

This is also available on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3744195)

## Focusing

With a Canon EOS 6D on a T-ring (1.25 inch), this focuses at just past 41mm.

With a Canon EOS 6D on a 2-inch T-Ring, this focuses at about 82.5mm.
