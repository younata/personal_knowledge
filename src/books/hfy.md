Short for Humanity, Fuck Yeah. These are sci-fi/fantasy stories about how humans are different than other species.

Some of my favorite examples are:

# SciFi

- [Contact Procedures](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/248g8d/oc_contact_procedures/). Humans are relatively advanced when an FTL gate is installed in their system. They are introduced to a corrupt government, figure out that said government is corrupt, gives them the finger and fights them. It's one of the best-written stories in the subreddit.
- [Intergalactic Challenge Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3dyrmm/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games/). Aliens host an Olympics-inspired event, this is the first event with humans, and humans troll the shit out of them. 5 part story.
  - [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3e6ucu/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games_ii/)
  - [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3ec1o6/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games_iii/)
  - [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3eobqj/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games_iv/)
  - [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3eocvu/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games_v/)

# Fantasy/Sci-Fi mix

- [The Magineer](https://www.themagineer.com/chapter-1/) is about a futuristic engineer who gets dumped in some fantasy/magic setting. Very interesting.
