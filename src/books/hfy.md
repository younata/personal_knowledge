# HFY

Short for Humanity, Fuck Yeah. These are sci-fi/fantasy stories about how humans are different than other species.

Some of my favorite examples are:

# SciFi

- [The Deathworlders](https://deathworlders.com/books/deathworlders/) is one of the original/foundational HFY stories. Humans are still pre-contact, yet there have been some that are illegally kidnapped/in space, and as it turns out, there they only ones to have evolved from a "deathworld" - a high-gravity planet with very competitive life.
- [Contact Procedures](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/248g8d/oc_contact_procedures/). Humans are relatively advanced when an FTL gate is installed in their system. They are introduced to a corrupt government, figure out that said government is corrupt, gives them the finger and fights them. It's one of the best-written stories in the subreddit.
- [Intergalactic Challenge Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3dyrmm/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games/). Aliens host an Olympics-inspired event, this is the first event with humans, and humans troll the shit out of them. 5 part story.
  - [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3e6ucu/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games_ii/)
  - [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3ec1o6/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games_iii/)
  - [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3eobqj/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games_iv/)
  - [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/3eocvu/oc_intergalactic_challenge_games_v/)
- [On the Shoulders of Giants](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/869f0e/on_the_shoulders_of_giants/) is a look at human rocket development (as of mid-2018 or so, pre BFR -> Starship/Super Heavy rename) from the perspective of them being museum pieces.
- [The Cult of Janus](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/93xgbo/the_cult_of_janus_oc/) - Humans set up a religion to seed spies and soldiers expecting some galactic war. To keep it's cover, the religion takes care of the community. Centuries later, another religion tries to start a holy war, and the Church of Janus responds.
- [Humanity's Debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2b1vqr/oc_humanitys_debt/). Doctors, fuck yeah.

# Fantasy/Sci-Fi mix

- [The Magineer](https://www.themagineer.com/chapter-1/) is about a futuristic engineer w/ AI implants who gets dumped in an MMORG setting where magic is, at it's most basic level, a programming language. Super interesting.
- [Finishing The Fight](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4108390/1/Halo-Finishing-the-Fight) is a halo/neverwinter nights fanfic. It's written pre-Halo 4, which honestly is a plus in my book.
