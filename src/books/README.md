# Books

I should leave reviews on [goodreads](https://goodreads.com), but I don't.

Some definition on genre:

I vastly prefer to read sci-fi and/or fantasy. Of that, I really enjoy [hard sci-fi](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness), but that's not a requirement.

Here's a list of books and other readings I enjoy:

## Books

Sorted by Author

### Andy Weir

- [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian) is a hard sci-fi book about someone left behind on one of the first missions to Mars, and his struggles to get back home.
- [Artemis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis) is a heist novel set in the first city on the moon. Like The Martian, it's also hard sci-fi.

### Scott Meyer

I really enjoy his [Magic 2.0](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18616975-off-to-be-the-wizard) series, though it does have a significant drop-off in quality. The [first](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18616975-off-to-be-the-wizard) [two](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21483760-spell-or-high-water) books are amazing, the [third](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest) is pretty good, but not as good as the previous two. But the [reviews for the fourth one](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36566205-fight-and-flight) have kept me from continuing.

### Fletcher DeLancey

My partner turned me on to her. Her [Chronicles of Alsea series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39333098-the-caphenon) is pretty great, though at times it reads like the fan fiction it grew out of. They're still highly worth reading.

## Other Readings

- [HFY](https://reddit.com/r/hfy) is a subreddit where people share stories sci-fi/fantasy stories where humans are the badasses. Usually by picking one particular trait of humans and overexagerrating it to give them an advantage over other species.
