- [Briefings]({{#path_for Briefings}}) covers receiving weather briefings. It could use a lot of fleshing out.
- [Icing]({{#path_for Icing}}) covers icing specifically.

## Weather Forecast and Advisories

Airmets, sigmets, convective sigmets, PIREPs (Pilot reports), METARs, TAFs, etc.

### Airmets

Airmets are advisories of significant weather that may affect all aircraft, but particularly lighter aircraft - i.e. airlines are less concerned with these. They are valid for 6 hours from time of issue, and have the following subtypes:

- Airmet T (Tango): Moderate turbulence, sustained surface 30+ kts, and/or non-convective low-level wind shear.
- Airmet Z (Zulu): Moderate icing and provides freezing level heights.
- Airmet S (Sierra): Describes IFR conditions and/or mountain obscuration.
- Airmet G (Graphical): Found at [aviationweather.gov](https://www.aviationweather.gov)

For example, the coastal fog on the west coast usually results in Airmet Sierras being issued.

### Sigmets

Sigmets are more significant airmets and are potentially hazardous to all types of aircraft. For what I do, a relevant sigmet means you're not flying today. They are valid for 4 hours from time of issue, and are issued when the following is expected:

- Severe icing not associated with thunderstorms
- Severe or extreme turbulence or clean air turbulence not associated with thunderstorms.
- Dust storms, sandstorms, and other non-thunderstorm phenomena lowering surface visibility below 3 miles.

For example, the ash spewed from an erupting volcano would cause a sigmet to be issued.

### Convective Sigmets

Essentially Sigmets for thunderstorms.

Valid for 2 hours after issue, convective sigmets contain either an observation and a forecast, or only a forecast. All convective sigmets imply severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and low level wind shear.

They are issued for any of the following:

- Severe thunderstorms, due to:
  - Surface winds 50+ kts
  - Surface hail greater than 3/4 inch in diameter.
- Tornadoes
- Embedded thunderstorms of any intensity level
- a line of thunderstorms at least 60 miles long with thunderstorms affecting at least 40% of its length
- Thunderstorms producing
heavy or greater precipitation (VIP level 4) affecting at least 40% of an area of at least 3000 square miles.
