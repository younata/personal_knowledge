# NOTAMs

NOtice To AirMen. Microaggression aside, NOTAMs are the way to distribute temporary (and not-so-temporary) notices about... just about anything in aviation.

There are 5 subtypes of NOTAMs:

- (D) NOTAMs
  - "Information that requires wide dissemination via telecommunication, regarding enroute navigation aids, civil public-use airports listed in the *Chart Supplement U.S.*, facilities, services, and procedures." (Instrument Pilot Oral Exam Guide, ASA)
  - These will have keywords contained in the first part of the text, which identifies what the NOTAM is specifically about. These include:
    - "RWY, TWY, APRON, AD, OBST, NAV, COM, SVC,AIRSPACE, ODP, SID, STAR, CHART, DATA, IAP, VFP, ROUTE, SPECIAL, SECURITY, (U) or (O)."
- FDC NOTAMs
  - "Flight information that is regulatory in nature including, but not limited to, changes to IFR charts, procedures, and airspace usage." (Instrument Pilot Oral Exam Guide, ASA)
- Pointer NOTAMs
  - "Issued by a flight service station to highlight or point out another NOTAM; Used to assist users in cross-referencing important information that may not be found under an airport or NAVAID identifier". (Instrument Pilot Oral Exam Guide, ASA) Essentially, analog links.
- Military NOTAMs
  - Fairly self-explanatory, NOTAMs related to the US military navigational aids and airports.
- SAA NOTAMs
  - These note when Special Activity Airspace "will be active outside the published schedule[d] times and when required." (Instrument Pilot Oral Exam Guide, ASA)
  - Examples of Special Activity Airspace include:
    - Special use airspace (Restricted, MOAS, warning, alert areas)
    - Instrument & visual military training routes
    - aerial refueling tracks & anchors.
