Mnemonic to go over before you even go to the airport.

- Illness: Are you sick or feel like you're becoming sick.
- Medication: Taking anything not allowed, or otherwise out of the ordinary?
- Stress: Are you stressed/worried about other things? Want to be in a good headspace.
- Alcohol: >8 hours bottle to throttle in the US.
- Fatigue: Had enough sleep? Had enough to eat?
- Emotion: How are you feeling? Are you mentally well enough to fly?

For me, "am I able to make the bike ride to SMO?" is enough to answer all of these.
