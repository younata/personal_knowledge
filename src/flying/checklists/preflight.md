# Preflight checklists

Mnemonics and other things to consider, often before you even get to the airport

## IMSAFE

Mnemonic to go over before you even go to the airport. Covers how you are doing.

- Illness: Are you sick or feel like you're becoming sick.
- Medication: Taking anything not allowed, or otherwise out of the ordinary?
- Stress: Are you stressed/worried about other things? Want to be in a good headspace.
- Alcohol: >8 hours bottle to throttle in the US.
- Fatigue: Had enough sleep? Had enough to eat?
- Emotion: How are you feeling? Are you mentally well enough to fly?

For me, "am I able to make the bike ride to SMO?" is usually enough to answer all of these.

## PAVE

Helps you perceive hazards and assess risks.

- P: Pilot  
  Am I ready for this flight? - in terms of experience, recency, currency, physical and emotional connections. See IMSAFE for answers to the latter 2.
- A: Aircraft  
  - Is this the right aircraft for the flight?
  - Am I familiar with and current in the aircraft?
  - Is this aircraft properly equipped for the flight? (Instruments, lights, navigation and communication equipment)
  - Can this aircraft use the runways available for the trip w/ margin for safety & weather?
  - Can this aircraft carry the planned load?
  - Can it operate at the intended altitudes?
  - Does it have sufficient fuel capacity for each leg?
  - Does it actually have the necessary fuel in it?
- V: Environment
  - Weather
  - Terrain
  - Airports
  - Airspace
  - Nighttime
- E: External Pressures  
  Other things influencing the flight.
  - Someone waiting at the airport for the arrival of the flight
  - passenger the pilot doesn't want to disappoint (See: hazardous attitudes)
  - desire to impress someone (see: hazardous attitudes)
  - desire to demonstrate pilot qualifications (see: hazardous attitudes)
  - desire to satisfy a personal goal ("get-there-itis")
