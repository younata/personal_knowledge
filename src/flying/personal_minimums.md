# Personal Minimums

[The FAA has a personal minimums worksheet available](https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/library/documents/2007/Jan/14078/6.2%20Personal%20Minimums%20Worksheet.pdf). Here's an adapted version of that.

Weather Categories are as follows:

| Category | Ceiling (feet AGL) | Visibility (Statute Miles) |
|----------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| VFR      | > 3,000            | > 5 miles                  |
| MVFR     | 1,000 to 3,000     | 3 to 5 miles               |
| IFR      | 500 to 999         | 1 to < 3 miles             |
| LIFR     | < 500              | < 1 mile                   |

Basically, I have very conservatives minimum at the moment. Which is fine, because I fly light aircraft for fun. I also am relatively inexperienced - at the time of this writing, I have just about 200 hours total time, which is in that danger zone of ~100 to ~500 hours where most GA accidents occur in.
