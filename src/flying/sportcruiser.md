# SportCruiser

Notes on flying a [SportCruise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CZAW_SportCruiser). A lot of this comes in comparison to a Cessna 172, which is the standard training airplane.

As with most of my other flying related pages, this comes with caveat of I am not a CFI, and in particular this is not the POH. Don't be an idiot and think this is anything other than a way for me to have easily accessible and searchable notes.

## Emergency Procedures

The C part of the checklist:

- [] Throttle: Cracked
- [] Choke: Off
- [] Switch tanks
- [] Carb heat: On
- [] Fuel pump: On
- [] Master: On
- [] Starter: Engage (if prop is stopped)
