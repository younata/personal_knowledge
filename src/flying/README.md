# Flying

Notes on Flying and Aviation.

Everything from [writeups of notable flights]({{#path_for flight writeups}}), notes on [airports]({{#path_for Big Bear City Airport, L35}}) and some of the [noise abatement procedures]({{#path_for noise abatement}}) around them, to a bunch of theory and how to actually operate an airplane.

Basically, more information gets added to this subsection as I study for an additional rating or license. Currently studying for an instrument rating.
