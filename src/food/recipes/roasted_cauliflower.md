# Roasted Cauliflower

Guest Writer: Nicole Fronda

I more or less follow [this recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/roasted-cauliflower-recipe-1945072) described on FoodNetwork.

## Ingredients

* 1 head of cauliflower
* Olive Oil
* Chopped Garlic. Even better is mince garlic.(When I’m without garlic, I use garlic salt as substitute, but that’s not nearly as good.)
* Some Thyme. 1 tblspoon is good for me.
* Some salt. Go easy if you use the garlic salt too.
* Some crushed black pepper.
* A dash of crushed red pepper.

## Assembly
 
 Chop the cauliflower. Then dump all the ingredients in a large plastic bag. Seal. Shake vigorously.  
 
 Release the ingredients from the plastic bag into a  casserole dish.  Bake in 450 degree F oven for about 20 minutes or until golden.

## Serve

As a side or by itself!
