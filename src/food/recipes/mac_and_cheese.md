# Mac and Cheese

Really, this is cheesy pasta, because you don't have to use macaroni.

This is infinitely better than box mac and cheese, and just as simple.

(By the way, for box mac and cheese, the best is Annie's white cheddar shells).

## Ingredients

Fairly simple

- Cheese (whatever you have is fine - it needs to be shredded before it goes in, or even better: grated.)
- Milk (any kind, even the vegan milks)
- Pasta (shells, rotini, though I guess any kind of pasta should be fine, I like having smaller noodles, though)
- Butter (4 oz or so)

## Process

- Fill a medium-sized pot or saucepan with water, remembering to salt it enough to taste like seawater.
- Get it to a boil, then add the pasta.
- Boil the pasta for however long the packaging says.
    - While this is going, prepair the rest of the ingredients.
        - get the right amount of butter.
        - shred or grate the cheese.
        - get the milk out.
- Drain the pasta, put the butter in the same pan and get it to melt.
- Add the cheese and milk. Cheese first.
    - I eyeball the milk - pouring for about half a second or a second is usually enough. You're aiming for about 2 oz.
- Stir until everything comes together. There's a decent chance there's not enough heat left to melt the cheese entirely, that's fine.
- Add the pasta back in and stir.

Enjoy.
