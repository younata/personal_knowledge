# Slow-Cooked Pinto Beans

Dried pinto beans are very nutritious and are significantly cheaper than canned beans. Here's how to prepare them in a slow cooker:

3 parts water to 1 part beans. (e.g. 3 cups water for every cup of beans).

Combine in a slow cooker. Heat on low for 6-8 hours. Replenish the water if it gets too low.

Strain the beans into a container. It keeps reasonably well in the fridge.
