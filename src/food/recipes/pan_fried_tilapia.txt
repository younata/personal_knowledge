# Pan Fried Tilapia

Guest Writer: Nicole Fronda

My favorite meal growing up! And it’s probably Rachel’s favorite recipe of mine. 

## Ingredients

* 2 filets of Tilapia (Although theoretically you could use fillets any fish you like. Your cook time may vary if you do!)
* Olive oil. 1-2 tablespoons should do.
* A dab of butter.
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* Flour

## Assembly

Defrost the fish if needed. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Cover both sides of each filet in flour.

Heat up a large pan with the oil and butter. Place the filets in the pan. Let cook for 6 minutes or until golden brown on the side. Flip and cook for another 6 minutes or until golden brown on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.

## Serve

With any sides you like but I prefer steamed rice and veggies!
