# Gumbo

Gumbo is a kind of soup from cajun cuisine. It's delicious & perfect for cooler times of year.

An adaptation from [this recipe by Alton Brown](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/shrimp-gumbo-recipe-1946875). Basically, traditional gumbo, only with much less stirring. Nobody wants to be stirring for an hour and a half.

This is a very high-spoon recipe. It requires about 1.5 hours of active time, and about 2.5 hours of total time - It's A Lot. It keeps relatively well, thankfully. Get a friend/partner to help with stirring. The more the merrier.

## Ingredients

### Roux

Equal parts:
- Vegetable oil
- Flour

### Soup

equal parts: 
- diced onion
- diced celery
- diced green pepper

- minced garlic

- broth (homemade or store-bought. Whatever. You can also buy bouillon cubes and add them to water to make broth)

Seasonings:
- bay leaves
- Other spices to taste (pepper, salt, thyme, cayenne pepper, etc.)

Final thickening:
- File powder

### Protein

#### Vegan

For a vegan gumbo, here's what I recommend:
- Vegan sausage, andouille is best. Cut it into rounds, brown them in a skillet, and add it at the end.

Any/all of:

- Firm tofu. Cut into pieces, brown them in a skillet w/ oil & spices, add it once the onions are transparent.
- Mushrooms (any kind). Add them once the onions are transparent.
- Kidney beans. Add them once the onions are transparent.

#### Meat-based Gumbo

For non-vegetarian gumbo, I'm a massive fan of chicken and sausage.
- Buy a roasted chicken, tear off the meat, and add it to the gumbo at the end.
- Use andouille sausage, cut it into rounds, brown them in a skillet, and add it at the end.

## Instructions

Roux:

- Preheat oven to 350° F (~180° C)
- Mix flour and vegetable oil in a large pot & put it in the oven uncovered for 90 minutes. Whisk the roux every 20 minutes.

- While the roux is baking, make your broth & prepare the protein.
- Near the end, be sure to dice the onion, celery, and green pepper in preparation of pulling it out.

Soup:

- Once the roux finishes, put it on the stove on medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, green pepper and garlic and stir until the onion starts to turn transparent. This should take less than 10 minutes, but will feel much longer.
- Add the seasonings & stir to combine.
- If you're doing vegan/vegetarian gumbo, this is also a good time to add the tofu, mushrooms, and kidney beans.
- Add the broth.
- Reduce heat to low, cover & let cook for 30-35 minutes. (Make the rice during this break).
- Turn off the heat. Add the rest of the protein (any meat, the vegan sausage, etc.). Let sit for 10 minutes.
- Serve over rice.
