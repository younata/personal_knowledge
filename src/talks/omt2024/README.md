# OMT 2024 - Testing Swift Concurrency and SwiftUI

The talk I gave at [One More Thing 2024](https://omt-conf.com), a community-organized conference for iOS developers held during the week of WWDC.

The talk was recorded and last I heard they were working on getting videos out of it, but I don't have a link yet.

[The slides, however, are available as a PDF](testing_swift_concurrency_and_swiftui.pdf).
