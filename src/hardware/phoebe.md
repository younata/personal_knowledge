# Phoebe

Phoebe is an [ARRMA-RC Raidel BLS rc car](https://www.arrma-rc.com/rc-cars/latest/raider/bls) that I've spent the past 4 years off and on making semi-autonomous.

## Motors

Phoebe came stock with an arrma-rc BLS ESC & Motor combination. This is a sensorless brushless motor, which is not ideal for a robot, and I've been on the hunt for a suitable sensored replacement.

From [the specs](https://www.arrma-rc.com/power-systems/latest/bls), the motor is:

|Component      |Measurement|Unit|
|---------------|-----------|----|
|Diameter       | 35.8      | mm |
|Length         | 54        | mm |
|Shaft Length   | 13        | mm |
|Shaft Diameter | 3         | mm |
|Motor Speed    | 4000      | kv |
|Poles          | 2         |    |

Any replacement motor, to fit on the car, needs to match the physical dimensions. To keep a similar performance (I don't care to replace the gearbox - I might as well buy a new platform if I do so), I also want it to have a similar speed as the stock motor.
