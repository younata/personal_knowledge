# Bicycle Trailer

This is a design for a cargo bicycle trailer, similar to the [Bikes At Work](https://www.bikesatwork.com) trailer, but without the 7 month lead time. If you're looking for a cargo bike trailer, you really should just get a bikes at work trailer.

Instead of an aluminum trailer, this will be made out of wood. This is designed mostly for ease of construction, with not as much of a regard for weight. I'll be attaching this to an electric bicycle, which'll be more than powerful enough to pull what I put on this.

Note: As of this writing I haven't built this yet.

## Materials

This is constructed with 2x6 studs as the side runners, with a number of 2x4 studs as the inner supports, or ribs. The front end is also made out of a 2x6 stud, as are the wheel holders/cavities.

- 2x6 studs:
  - 2x 8' long stud (each side runner)
  - 1x 27" long stud (front end)
  - 4x 5.5" long studs (ends of the wheel cavities)
  - 2x 22.5" long studs (sides of the wheel cavities)
- 2x4 studs:
  - 8x 24" long studs (each rib)
- Other materials:
  - 2x 16" bicycle wheels
  - 4x ball bearings (size?)
  - 2x bicycle skewers
  - TODO: Hardware to attach the trailer to the bicycle
  - Sealant for the wood.
  - Paint!

For the studs, you can get 3x 8' 2x6 studs, plus 3x 8' 2x4 studs, and that'll get you the amount you need + enough for other projects.
