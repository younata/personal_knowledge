Hardware-based projects

## Inspiration

DIY Projects other people have done that inspire me.

## Wearable Computer

Look like an 80s computer geek! Inspired by [this project on adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/piglass-wearable-raspberry-pi-computer/overview), the idea is to build a much sleeker version of this. Potentially for use while cycling, flying, or otherwise as I think about it.

## DIY Smartwatch

## Automatic Fume Extractor

Been wanting to build my own, at it's simplest, it's a fan connected to an activated charcoal filter.
