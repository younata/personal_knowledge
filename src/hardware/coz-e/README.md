A lot of these point to non-secure sites.

- [The unofficial cozy builders web site](http://www.cozybuilders.org), run by Marc Zeitlin.
- [Cozy Girrrls](http://www.cozygirrrl.com/) makes and sells parts for the Cozy and other canards. They also have a site (very 90s) on how they built their cozy.
- [John Slade's](http://canardaviation.com/cozy/) page on building his Cozy.
- [Phillip Johnson's Kinda Kozy](http://www.canardaviation.com/PhillipJohnson/index.htm) has a subaru engine, fully retractable gear (which makes the cozy look so much better, even with the retracts deployed, a front hinge canopy w/ gull wing passenger entrance.
- [Cozy Serenity](https://cozyserenity.weebly.com) (unknown who the builder is) has a really detailed, modern build log. Definitely standing on the shoulders of giants type deal.
- [Eureka CNC](http://www.eurekacnc.com) - this guy built a CNC hot wire machine, and sells jigs that are CNC'd, or fully CNC'd out foam cores.
