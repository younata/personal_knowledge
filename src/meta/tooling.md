# Client-Side Tooling

Some tools I wrote to help make my usage of this repo easier.

Mostly, this is the [Second Brain](https://github.com/younata/second_brain) iOS application I wrote. This simple tool stores a copy of this locally, and uses the spotlight hooks available on iOS to allow searching through the contents of it.
