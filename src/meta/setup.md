# How This is Setup

This is setup using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook). It's hosted as a [repository on github](https://github.com/younata/personal_knowledge). I set up a pipeline in [concourse](https://concourse-ci.org) to build, check that things work, and then push new versions once things are set up.

[TL;DR, check out these instructions](duplicating.md)

## Repository Layout

This is a simple mdbook, the actual content files is under `src/`. `SUMMARY.md` is missing, because I have [tooling to automatically generate one automatically](https://github.com/younata/mdbook-generate-summary).

## Pipeline

The pipeline[^pipeline] is relatively simple:

- Check for new pushes to master
- Generate a SUMMARY.md for the book.
- Build the book (using [this mdbook docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hrektts/mdbook))
- Test that the generated book isn't broken (mostly verify the links work) using [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer), via [this docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/18fgsa/html-proofer).
- rsync the updated book to the server hosting the contents.

## Server Setup

The server hosting this is a [linode](https://linode.com) VPS. It gets deployed to/managed via an ansible playbook. The current setup is pretty bad/full of bad patterns, but needless to say that playbook manages setting up nginx, getting letsencrypt set up, and configuring nginx to serve the static files for this repository.

On Sol, the repository containing this playbook is located at `~/workspace/Apps`.

## Offline/Development Setup

For making changes and doing a local preview (or just simply running locally), the following setup is recommended/required:

- Rust/Cargo: Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- mdbook-generate-summary: `cargo install mdbook-generate-summary` will get you an out-of-date version. The CI uses a dockerimage for this, but that docker image is not yet set up for local usage. The "best" way to get an up-to-date version is to download the source, and run `cargo install --path .`. Which isn't the best way to distribute software. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- mdbook: `cargo install mdbook`

Running:

`mdbook-generate-summary` will build a SUMMARY.md file for you. This way, you don't have to maintain one.

`mdbook watch` will build your sources, watch for any changes to the `src/` directory, and serve up the book on localhost:3000.

I do this for my work repository, which I want to keep separate from my personal stuff.

## Spellcheck

After noticing an embarrassing amount of spelling errors on this (one of the drawbacks to editing this mostly in vim), I spent time looking into how to spellcheck markdown files.

Regardless, I've used [markdown-spellchecker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-spellcheck) (which I discovered via [this article](https://pawel.krupa.net.pl/2018/07/automate-your-grammar-checks/)) to locally spellcheck this, using this command:

```bash
mdspell --ignore-acronyms --ignore-numbers --en-us "**/*.md"
```

## Future Work

- Automatically add a "last updated" line immediately below the title for a page, to make it obvious when I'm looking at outdated information. Could get the last updated information from git ([`git --no-pager log -n 1 --pretty=format:%ci path/to/file`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14244466)). (Update: 2020-04-18, this is now done. Leaving this here because I still kinda want to do this on a per-subsection basis.)
  - It would be extra cool to this for each subsection on a page.
- On a per-section basis, add other lines to show up for all pages in that section (e.g. I want everything in my [flying](../flying/) section to have the "This is for my own use and is not flight instruction" disclaimer).
- Figure out a way to actually support checkboxes and such, as how github does. This might require a change to upstream mdbook.
