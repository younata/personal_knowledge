# 3D Printing

I have a [Prusa i3 mk3](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3-kit.html). It's a really nice desktop 3d printer available as a kit. Having a 3d printer has been pretty great for all the little things you can do with it, despite not really having a big single "thing" to be the actual driver to get one. Ours doesn't see all that much usage (we've been able to go a couple months between uses), but it's really nice to have ready to use with little prep.

## Using

Checklist for using it.

### Preparing the Model

This assumes you already have a model you want to print. This uses the [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/) slicer.

- Insert SD card from printer into computer.
- Open and orient your model in PrusaSlicer.
  - Does your model have overhangs or other parts that need support to print? If yes, add supports.
- Export the G-Code to the SD card.
- Eject the SD card and plug it back into the printer.

### Using the Printer

- Wipe down the printer bed (the metal sheet you print on) with a paper towel and isopropyl alcohol.
- Turn on printer, select the model from the SD card (menu -> print from SD card -> select model)
- Watch the printer as it prints the first layer.
- If the filament is known to get caught on itself, watch/listen to the printer, if the filament starts to get tight, undo/give the printer some slack.

### Replacing filament

There are official instructions... somewhere.

- Turn on printer.
- Turn on print-head heater.
- Wait ~5 minutes or so.
- Eject old filament.
- Cut ~45Â° angle into the new filament.
- Replace with new filament.
