# To Don't

The opposite of a ToDo list.

This is mostly lists of projects I am interested in starting, but I know I shouldn't. These definitely could work with a team of people (or with more funding than I'm willing to put into it), but for a solo project, these aren't worth it.

- Web Browser. Something maybe like [Midori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_(web_browser)) was a number of years ago (I last used it ~2010). Frankly, outside of basic stuff you can build on top of `WKWebView`, browsers aren't worth it. There's an (unfortunate) reason that there are really only 3 browsers out there.
- Email client. I actually built one ages ago when I was still in high school. Learned how to use POP and SMTP from that. But with more modern requirements, email clients aren't worth my time.
- Search Engine. I am pretty certain I could fairly quickly clone Google circa 2000 in terms of code. However, the cost of indexing the web would be enormous and is not something I'm willing to do. It would require a fairly large amount of resources, when, ultimately, duck duck go is good enough for now. If the state of search engines continues to decline, then perhaps I'll have to redo this calculus.
