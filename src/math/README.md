## Matrices

Matrices are two dimensional arrays of numbers, e.g.

\\[
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\\\3 & 4\\\\5 & 6\end{bmatrix}
\\]

describes a 3 by 2 matrix.

A matrix is described by the number of rows, then the number of columns.

### Matrix Multiplication

Matrix Multiplication is the process of multiplying two compatible matrices together. Unlike scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication is not commutative - that is, if `a` and `b` are matrices, \\(a * b\\) is not guaranteed to produce the same matrix that \\(b * a\\) produces.

In order to be compatible, the number of columns in matrix `a` must equal the number of rows in matrix `b`. This will produce a matrix that has the same number of rows as matrix `a` and the same number of columns as matrix `b`.

Note that this is also called the dot product.
