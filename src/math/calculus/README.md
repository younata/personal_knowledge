# Intro to Calculus

Calculus is one of my favorite branches of mathematics, because it's about manipulating functions.

Calculus is really a progression from earlier levels of continuous mathematics (as opposed to discrete mathematics) that starts in grade school.

First you learn about numbers (1, 2, 3...) and how to manipulate them (arithmetic). Later, you learn about functions and that they're about manipulating arithmetic and expressions (algebra).

Calculus is about manipulating algebra and functions. Computing things like how fast a function is changing or how much a function has changed. Calculus is also about exploring where algebra starts to break down - e.g. finding the value of a function that is undefined at a given input.
