# Antarctica

The seventh continent, at the bottom of the world.

Antarctica is the highest, driest, and most desolate place on Earth.

## Jon Johanson's RV-4 Flight to McMurdo

In 2003, Australian Jon Johanson had the great idea to fly his modified RV-4 down to McMurdo. He even overflew the south pole station, before turning back and landing at McMurdo. There he was stranded for a bit as McMurdo didn't want to supply him with fuel. He eventually had fuel donated to him and he was able to fly out.

## US Antarctic Program

The USAP manages the US-run stations and research vessels, such as McMurdo and the south pole station.

## Working in Antarctica

Again, this is only relevant for US-based persons such as myself. You can work directly through the USAP in either a management position (not likely to deploy), or a scientist position (more likely to deploy). Additionally, the USAP contracts with several companies for support staff.

I find the idea of working in Antarctica intriguing, but I would not be willing to make the sacrifice required to do so. It would definitely be an adventure, but being cut off from the rest of the world for 6 months sounds like a bit too much.
