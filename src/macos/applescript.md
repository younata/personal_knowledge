# Applescript

Applescript is pretty terrible, but very useful for scripting mac apps. You could use javascript for this, as of 10.11, but there's no documentation for using javascript to script OSX applications.

## Concatenating strings

Use the `&` operator to concatenate strings. Unlike `+` as in almost all other languages.

`"Something " & "something else"` -> `"Something something else"`
