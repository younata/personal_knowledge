# macOS

The only desktop OS worth using. (iOS being the only mobile OS worth using).

## BitBar

[BitBar](https://getbitbar.com) is a really neat menubar app for macOS that lets you write simple command-line programs as separate menu bar apps.

### Plugins

- I have a modified version of [Github review requests](https://getbitbar.com/plugins/Dev/GitHub/github-review-requests.5m.py) to notify me when I have PRs to review for work.

## LaunchD and LaunchAgents

[launchd.info](https://www.launchd.info) is an excellent resource for using launchd and creating launchagents.
