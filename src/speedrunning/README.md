# Speedrunning

Completing a game in as little time as possible.

Actually engaging in speedrunning is not really for me. But watching other people speedrun games is entertaining.

## Games Done Quick

[GDQ](https://gamesdonequick.com) is what got me in to speedrunning. As of early 2020, they engage in 3 events every years - Awesome Games Done Quick is a weeklong event held in January and supports the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Summer Games Done Quick is weeklong event held in June/July and supports Doctors Without Borders. Finally, GDQx is held weekend event at twitchcon and supports various charities.

### Calendars

[Horaru.org](https://horaro.org) is a neat site that translates the GDQ schedules into ical formats, so that you can subscribe in your own calendar program.
