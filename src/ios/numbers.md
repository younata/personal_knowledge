## Sheets

### Renaming a Sheet

This is surprisingly non-obvious. [You double-tap it to select the text, then you can edit it from there](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH23855?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US). I thought there would be something involving a long-press, but that only allows you to move the sheet around. Similarly, a single-tap brings up an edit menu that allows you to cut (remove and place in pasteboard), copy (place in pasteboard), duplicate, or delete the sheet.

## Conditional Formatting

On mac, click the format button, go to the "cell" tab, then select conditional highlighting.
