# Tesla

I have a Model 3.

## Keyfob

The optional keyfob is an extra $150, because of course it is. It's actually kind of nice because you can use it to remotely lock/unlock the car without using your phone (I don't trust the "lock when walking away" to lock soon enough). It's also nice when you have to valet the car because a keyfob is more standard than the key card.

### Summon with the Keyfob

As of 2019.7.11, you can use the keyfob with summon. It requires "Requires Continuous Press" in the summon settings to be off, but once that's a thing, you press on the "roof" button of the car until the emergency lights and such turn on, then you press on the frunk (forward) or trunk (backward) button to move the car. Press on the roof button again to stop.
