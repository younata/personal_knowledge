# Methodologies and Practices

About the schools of thought around how to better develop software.

This is near and dear to me, as I spent the first several years of my career at the consulting arm of Pivotal - Pivotal Labs. Where we worked with clients to try to help them get better at writing software. I definitely drunk the kool-aid in a way that's still affecting me today.

## Extreme Programming

The basic idea behind [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) (usually abbreviated as XP) is to take the good parts of older software engineering practices and take them to "extreme" levels. For example, from wikipedia: Code reviews are good, why not do them all the time? i.e. pair programming.

Pivotal came up with a variant of Extreme Programming they called the "Scaled Agile Framework". Despite the corporate name, it's fairly good and something I'm comfortable with.

[It] is a good way to introduce a lot of the HOW and justify it in terms of the values."
