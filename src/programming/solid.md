# SOLID

Per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), SOLID is an acronym for 5 design principles in object-oriented-programming. These principles are:

- Single Responsibility
- Open-Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface segregation
- Dependency Inversion

## Single Responsibility

A class/interface should have one and only one responsibility.

## Open-Closed

Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution

AKA Design by contract.

All objects that conform to a given interface should be treated as interchangeable.

## Interface segregation

It's better to have 20 different interfaces/protocols, than 1 god interface/protocol.

## Dependency Inversion

Depend upon interfaces, not a specific concrete implementation.
